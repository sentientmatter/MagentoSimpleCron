# Introduction
SimpleCron is a Magento extension that removes the need to setup a crontab or Scheduled Task to periodically trigger your cron script.

It works by adding a small amount of javascript to every page, which performs an ajax request to trigger cron.

SimpleCron is great for running Magento on hosts that lack the ability to create scheduled tasks, or for anyone who wishes to simplify installation.

# Installation
The preferred way to install is to get the Magento Connect key from http://www.magentocommerce.com and install using the built in Magento Connect Manager.

If you prefer, you can download the source and upload it to your store's root.
